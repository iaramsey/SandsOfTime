State of the Clock - July 25, 2019

Mechanical 

- Polish gear teeth to hopefully fix the high pitch noise when rotating
- Permanently attach the brass counterweight to the arm; epoxy?
- Epoxy the mirrored rotunda panels to the wooden frame
- Figure out a way to mount the LCD panel so that it can be accessed but isn't in the way
- Put a cover on the arm to prevent people from getting fingers stuck

Software

- Account for the travel time of the arm in deciding when to start the rotation for more accurate timekeeping
	- Experiment with all of the hourglasses to figure out how long each travel time is 
	and create a massive lookup table to select the time to leave 
	- Definitely seems like more trouble than it is worth
- Prevent LED disk from going red before switching to the minute animation during extension
	- A global boolean to flag when the arm is extending
	- if Extending == False and HG <> (MinuteHG + 1)
		setSection(Start, End, rgb.Intenstiy(rgb#red,50))
	- if Extending == False and HG <> (DecimalMinute / 5)
		setSection(Start, End, rgb.Intenstiy(rgb#red,50))
	- Basically figure out if the arm is extending and figure out which HG it is extending towards to 
	prevent it from turing the LED disk red
- LED Night Mode
	- I think it would be nice to turn of the lights at night, both to prolong the life of the LEDs and to lessen the impact of the clock in a dark hallway
		- There is a boolean in place in the DecideLED method as of now, just need to tweak how it is assigned; right now it is after 8 pm and before 8 am,
		but it is only dependent on one reading of the AM/PM bit, which can be know to randomly flip momentarily, so there likely needs to be a system that 
		checks the AM/PM state over a longer period of time (i.e. if it has been AM for 5 seconds, could do this with an iterating counter)
- Lightshows
	- Better, different, or more patterns in the lightshow
	- Different lightshows every 15 minutes
	- Change lightshow back to only at top of the hour?
- Random red flashes
	- Could be encoders misreading (slow down the sampling rate?)
	- Loose wires?

Electrical

- Purchase and implement PCB; a "finished" design is in the PCB folder titled "Clock Schematic v.8_no_jumpers"
	- Probably needs improvement from someone who actually knows what they are doing (i.e. not me)
- Hopefully this will fix the burning out of the limit switch pin 
- Clean up/shorten wires 
- Right now there is a 5A fuse on the 5V supply
	- There were a few times this summer where it randomly blew; I just replaced it and it was fine; no working theories on why this is happening
	- When programming sometimes all the LEDS go white which will blow the fuse, I think temporarily unplugging the power/data to the 12 o'clock ring should fix it
	- Overall, the best answer is to probably put a higher amp fuse
